Course assignment 3:

Two parts:
	Similar to the first assignment and SVD part
		Step by step

Bezier and Catmull-Rom slines:
	"Select control points and draw splines"

	Plan a boat trip around the world.

	Select control point such that the path doesnt intersect with land.
	Path is smooth


	Create new figure.
		Not just imshow
		Gets new window
	
	Add control points and curves on top of image
		hold on -> Make sure drawings are on top.

	Support user input
		ginput -> look at docs (Pretty simple)
		Left click save x and y, middle/right click save control point and exit.


		Use while loop that checks if button is middle/right to break while.




	Fill matrices
		(4x4 for each spline type)


	Draw the splines
		Draw a smooth animation
			Addpoints and drawnow (Nice animation)
		
		Save figure and insert into assignment



Least Square Approximation - 40%
	Find your own dataset (Find meaningful, something interesting)
		A couple of hundre to begin with


	Functional form -> For some x we have a y (2D data)

	

	Three approximation
		Constant
		Linear
		Quadratic

		Do not use polyfit

	Draw approximations in same plot
		All datapoints -> Scatterplot
		Then draw curves/lines
		


Exercise sheet:
	Gradient decent:
		Tensor product patch -> "Ferguson patch"
		
		Four points in 3d
		Linear interpolation that creates the patch

		Formula from slides. Note not hermite matrix (-1 1; 1 0) linear interpolation matrix
		

Linear programming
	Make a 2D drawing
	Draw lines, simplex method

	(ligner pÃ¥ 170)

Taylor
	Focus on second table


	4.3.4 -> make an estimation: "Think about how big the difference in the next step will be"

Numerical integration
	h is step size, use 1/4 as step size

	Simpsons is a little different

	Functions in the slides

	Fill in numbers and calculate


Bayes theorem
	Identify different events
	Solve for the missing


Statistics
	Calculate mean median mode var ...
	Equations in lecture slides

4.7 
	More difficult

4.8
	Questions to the videos of Geoff cummings
	Answer are directly in the videos.
