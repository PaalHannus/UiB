Part-of-Speech == Ordklasser

    There are eight parts of speech in the English language: noun, pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb,
    preposition, conjunction, and interjection. The part of speech indicates how the word functions
    in meaning as well as grammatically within the sentence.

The most important parts-of-speech are nouns, verbs and adjectives

    Nouns: Refer to people, animals and concepts
    Verbs: Express an action, or state of being
    Adjectives: Modify or describe properties of nouns

A substitution test can be used to determine if words are in the same class

    Simple test to check whether words are in the same class. Substitute a word with another, if it still is syntactically correct it's most likely in the same class

Word classes are commonly separated into two: Open and Closed

- Open word classes are the ones with a large number of members, such as nouns, verbs and adjectives.
- Closed word classes have fewer members: For instance prepositions and articles

Morphology:

    - Inflections
        - Systematic modification of word by means of prefixes and suffixes
        - Does not alter the class or meaning of a word significantly
        - Tense, number, plurality

        dog -> dogs (same class, same meaning-ish)

    - Derivations
        - Less systematic suffix modification
        - Often changes the meaning and class of a word

        1. happy -> happily (Adjective to adverb, different class)
        2. soft -> soften (Adjective to verb)
        3. understand -> understandable (Verb to adjective)
        4. teach -> teacher (Verb to noun)


    - Compounding
        - Two or more words pronounced and meaning a single concept. E.i. combine words to create new words with new meaning.
        1. Noun-Noun: Tea kettle
        2. Adjective-Noun: Downmarket
        3. Preposition-Verb: Overcome
