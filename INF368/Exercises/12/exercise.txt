Exercise 1:

Concept: 
Horse ⊓ ∃finding.Wings ⊓ ∃finding.Horns

Concept inclusion:
Pegasus ⊆ Horse ⊓ ∃finding.Wings ⊓ ∃finding.Horns

If the horse were to have additional features it might no longer be classified as a Pegasus. Say a lions-head. Thus a pegasus is a subset of a horse with wings and horns. 


Exercise 2:
TRUE:
Simons parents are cats
	Simon is a cat
Simon does not prey on Pumbaa
	Pumbaa might not be a small animal

FALSE:
Cecil is a lion
A lion is a cat
Cecil preys on buffalo
	Buffalo are small animals (Fallacy in definition?)

OR
Pumbaa preys on small animals (Bugs mostly)
Pumbaa is a cat
Transitive fallacy, the fact that pumbaa preys on small animals does not mean he is a cat.
