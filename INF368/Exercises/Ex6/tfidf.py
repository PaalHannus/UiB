language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or
simply "the Bard"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long
narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major
living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. They also continue to be studied and
reinterpreted."""

string2 = """Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway,
with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began
a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's
Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where
 he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation
about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to
him were written by others. """

string3 = """Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and
histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until
1608, among them Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest
works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and
collaborated with other playwrights. """
