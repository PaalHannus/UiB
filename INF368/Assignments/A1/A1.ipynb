    "# Assignment 1 - *Linguistic Essentials and Collocations*\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: I decided to write the entire report in this notebook. Everything you will need to run the program is found here. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "A collocation is a phrase consisting of more than one word but these words more commonly co-occur in a given context than its individual word parts. For example, in a set of hospital related documents, the phrase ‘CT scan’ is more likely to co-occur than do ‘CT’ and ‘scan’ individually. ‘CT scan’ is also a meaningful phrase. Additionally they simply sound \"right\" to a native speaker. To capture the essence of a language it is important that NLP-models capture and include collocations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task of identifying collocations felt quite daunting at first. But using large corpora it is really not that challenging. There are two methods tried and tested in this notebook. Firstly identifying collocations using their frequency. This is the simplest way of detecting collocations. It works by simply counting the frequency of each bigram; Bigrams that occur frequently are likely to be collocations. Hence referred to as the frequency method. \n",
    "The second method in this notebook is the hypothesis test method (t-test). It is a simple statistical test where we assume that the two words are independent of each other. By comparing how often the words occur in total and how often they occur in conjuction we can use it as statistical evidence for them being a collocation or not. *If a word occurs much more frequently next to another spesific word than it does by alone, it is likely a collocation*.\n",
    "\n",

    "![https://miro.medium.com/max/803/1*NR6uUN5N9IJCqOCTUomE9g.png](hyp_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a collocation, \"social media\" (as seen in the example above) should be much more frequent than if the two words were truly independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly the notebook requires both - jupyter notebooks and python. Once both are installed, we simply need to install the natural language toolkit NLTK with a package manager. Pip being the simplest. (**pip install nltk**). No other downloads are required as the csv package is included in standard python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: When installing the toolkit, be sure to include the corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My approach: \n",
    "\n",
    "I actually did this in two ways originally (although I only included the methods below). First I solved 1.1 by using the functions/objects from the toolkit. *BigramCollocationFinder* from nltk.collocations being the most important. \n",
    "Then I pivoted, and chose to implement the functions \"from scratch\"... sort of. I used the already tagged words from the corpus to filter the bigrams, and used nltk.ngrams to generate all the bigrams. I decided to only include bigram-collocations where the first word is either a noun or an adjective, and the second word is a noun. Some collocations have a different structure than this, and it can easily be changed in the code. It was mostly for simplicity. \n",
    "Anyway, I decided to do it this way to make sure i understood the assignment correctly. And since i got the same results using both the builtin-approach and the custom-approach. I decided only to include one of them. Here are some articles explaining the builtin-approach (I found the medium article especially useful).\n",
    "\n",
    "https://medium.com/@nicharuch/collocations-identifying-phrases-that-act-like-individual-words-in-nlp-f58a93a2f84a\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.nltk.org/howto/collocations.html\n",
    "\n",
    "https://towardsdatascience.com/collocations-in-nlp-using-nltk-library-2541002998db\n",
    "\n",
    "Both functions (the frequency and hypothesis methods) include a parameter to change the corpus, and the threshold. The threshold is a way to filter out words that show little evidence for being collocations. \n",
    "\n",
    "When running the notebook two files will generate, \"hyp.csv\" and \"freq.csv\". Each of which contains the collocations found by each respective method. To correct the non-natural expressions the function fixCollocations is used. It takes a variable number of arguments, all of which will be used to generate bigrams. It is also possible to change the filename to use collocations stored in a different file. The function loops over all adjecent pairs of input arguments and checks if they contain any synonyms with the collocations stored on the datafile. \n"
